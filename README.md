# Want to Know
# Final Project- *Want To Know*

**Want To Know app** is an android app that allow to the user find a bunch of information using yelp to ask about some services the businesses on Yelp offer nowaday. Normally a user wants to do some activities like dancing or even organizing a part. Through the app they dont need to open Yelp App and checks all the places that are favourable for him/her to pursue their interest and contacts every place and its timings. With the "Wanttoknow" app, the user can select the list of the places, from the overall list and send a message to all of the selected places at once, stating that the user wants to learn dancing or the user wants to organize a birthday party.
This app uses the Yelp API to retrieve information on the Ratings and Location with the Phone Number and the Name of the Place. 

Time spent: **** hours spent in total

App Flow - 
User Sign up / Login in the App as a Person or Businesses, this second registered on Yelp as required
User 1: Any Person that would use the app to contact or get a service from any a business registered on Yelp. This user will use the email as “User Name” and define a password to Sign up on our App.Then, They can Log in on the app with the same information registered
User 2: All businesses being registered on Yelp


Flow for the User 1:
Once the user 1 was registered on our app the app will show the Search Screen
On the search screen the user 1 can search anything using the Search Bar
After writing on the Search Bar, the user can get a result list with all the businesses related to the searching
The user can select any business with the button “Add” and this button will add the business to a New list called Personal List.
The user can hit the button “Next” to Jump to the Personal List
Once on the Personal List, the user can verify if the first selection of businesses was correct. In case it wasn’t right, the user can swipe to the left to delete the service chosen before
If the user is sure of all the selections, the user can hit the button “with a envelop” to send a message and the app will show an screen with all the options to write message by a notification and create a door to open a Chat 
Important note: We are assuming for the first release that both users are using the app. 
The user will wait until getting an answer from every business contacted.
After the business answered.
